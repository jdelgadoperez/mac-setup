# Implementation Plans

This directory stores detailed implementation plans, architecture decisions, and task breakdowns created during development with Claude Code.

## Purpose

Plans in this directory serve as:
- Documentation of implementation approaches
- Historical record of decision-making
- Context for complex tasks spanning multiple sessions
- Knowledge base for future development

## Naming Convention

- `feature-name-plan.md` - Feature implementation plans
- `refactor-component-plan.md` - Refactoring strategies
- `bug-description-plan.md` - Bug fix approaches
- `YYYY-MM-DD-task-description.md` - Date-stamped task plans

## Usage

When Claude Code works on complex tasks, it will create detailed markdown plans here that outline:
- Implementation strategy
- Step-by-step breakdowns
- Technical considerations
- Testing approaches
- Success criteria

These plans are version-controlled to maintain project knowledge over time.
